I did not finish the AVLtree . My program will balance the tree but does not preserve the proper arrangement of the tree. I successfully isolated the nodes that need to be balanced but I think my rearrangement of the attached trees (T1-T4 in slides) is wrong, leading to the premature termination of displaying all nodes in order from highest to lowest. You can see the work I did on the AVLtree in TreeImplementation.c from line  92 to 192. }
